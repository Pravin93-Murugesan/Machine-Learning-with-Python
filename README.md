In this work, a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms are implemented. These systems learn from experience to create simple predictive models.

Core topics include:
  - Classification, regression, and conditional probability estimation
  - Generative and discriminative models
  - Linear models and extensions to nonlinearity using kernel methods
  - Ensemble methods such as boosting, bagging and random forests
  - Representation learning like clustering, dimensionality reduction, autoencoders and deep nets
  
The machine learning algorithms are used to classify images, identify salient topics in a corpus of documents, partition people according to personality profiles, and automatically capture the semantic structure of words and use it to categorize documents.

Datasets used:
  - 'MNIST' is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 28x28 gray-scale images handwritten digits. The original training set contains 60,000 examples and the test set contains 10,000 examples. 
  - 'Spine Injury' to classify back injuries for patients in a hospital, based on measurements of the shape and orientation of their pelvis and spine.
