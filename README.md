# Machine-Learning-with-Python
Analyzing different data to build descriptive and predictive models in Python, using Jupyter notebooks

In this work, a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms are implemented. These systems learn from experience to create simple predictive models.

Core topics include:
  - Classification, regression, and conditional probability estimation
  - Generative and discriminative models
  - Linear models and extensions to nonlinearity using kernel methods
  - Ensemble methods such as boosting, bagging and random forests
  - Representation learning like clustering, dimensionality reduction, autoencoders and deep nets
  
The machine learning algorithms are used to classify images, identify salient topics in a corpus of documents, partition people according to personality profiles, and automatically capture the semantic structure of words and use it to categorize documents.
