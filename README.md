In this work, a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms are implemented. These systems learn from experience to create simple predictive models.

Core machine learning topics covered:
  - Classification, regression, and conditional probability estimation
  - Generative and discriminative models
  - Linear models and extensions to nonlinearity using kernel methods
  - Representation learning like clustering, dimensionality reduction
  
The algorithms are used to classify images of numbers, predict spine injury type in patients, identify source of a wine bottle, predict progress of diabetes in patients, classify reviews as either positive or negative, predict the type of iris, and cluster similar animals together.

Datasets worked on:
  - **MNIST** is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 28x28 gray-scale images handwritten digits. The original training set contains 60,000 examples and the test set contains 10,000 examples. 
  - **Spine Injury** to classify back injuries for patients in a hospital, based on measurements of the shape and orientation of their pelvis and spine.
  - **Wine data** to find the source winery of a bottle of wine based on its visual or chemical features.
  - **Diabetes** to find the progress of the condition using patients medical data such as age, body mass index, blood pressure etc. 
  - **Sentiment** which consists of both positive & negative reviews on imdb.com, amazon.com, and yelp.com is used to learn a classifier from this data.
  - **Iris** consists samples from three species of Iris with each sample containing five distinctive features. 
  - **Animals with Attributes 2** consists samples from 50 species with each animal species containing 85 real-valued features. 
  
To view the Jupyter notebooks, use the link below:  
  - Look into the folder 'IPython notebooks' or
  - Use the [Jupyter nbviewer links](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Pravin93-Murugesan/Machine-Learning-with-Python/tree/master/IPython%20notebooks/) and try the option 'Execute on Binder' to play with the code and learn/refresh machine learning      concepts
